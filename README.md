Freak Reader
==================

Speed reading is based on the idea that you don't need to pronounce
a word in your head to understand it. By telling your inner voice
to shut up, you can drastically increase the rate at which you
comprehend words.

Standard speed reading programs work by flashing individual words
on your screen very rapidly, sometimes just 80ms per word. They
often have a "chunking" feature which lets you flash more than
one word at a time. With this setting, you could flash 2 words
next to each other for 160ms, for instance.

Typically, the story ends there, but Freak Reader takes chunking
one step further. The barrier to understanding words and chunks
in less time is likely a combination of formatting, physiological effects like refocusing your eyes, and the inherent difficulty of
the words and chunks you're reading.

For example, it's much easier to comprehend the chunk "Hi there"
than it is to understand "Markovian queueing" despite the fact
that both chunks contain two words. The rarity of the latter two words makes them harder to speed read.

Freak Reader leverages word frequency (get it, freq=freak haha...)
to intelligently allocate more time to complex chunks and less time
to simpler chunks. Alternatively, you can fix the width
of your chunks in pixels and allocate time as a function of
number of words and word complexity {WIP}.
